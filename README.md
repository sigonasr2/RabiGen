# RabiGen
A map generator for Rabi-Ribi to produce procedurally-generated maps for the game.

# Features
A couple of features in mind:

- Customizable difficulty, for easier/harder obtaining of key items in the game.
- Customizable game size, for a game that spans only one region to a game spanning all 10 available maps in the game. Making the game as short or as long as you'd like.
- Bosses with twists: More difficult stages for defeating bosses in; along with possible tag teaming of various bosses throughout the game.
- Randomly generated stages. Multiple puzzles will be strung together, making the player have to identify what items are required to beat certain rooms to unlock more items and to explore for them. Unique experience with every playthrough!
- Lots of landscapes and different scenery to keep the player interested and wanting to explore.
- Players should be able to input a seed to get a specific map generated.
